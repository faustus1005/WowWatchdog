## 📖 Overview

WoW-Watchdog is a robust PowerShell-based application designed to monitor the status of your favorite World of Warcraft private servers. WoW-Watchdog provides timely notifications, ensuring you're always informed using NTFY integration.

This tool runs quietly in the background, periodically checking specified servers and alerting you to changes such as a server going offline, or optionally, when the server is back online.

This version of the Wow Watcher app is geared towards being repack agnostic, so the core features of starting/stopping/notifying should work for most WoW Private servers. If you find a repack it does not work with, please let me know, I'm more than happy to add support.

## Features

### Watchdog & Service Control
- GUI-based watchdog for WoW server stacks (World/Auth/DB)
- Runs as a Windows Service via **NSSM**
- Process alias detection (e.g., `authserver` / `bnetserver`, `mysqld`/MariaDB variants)
- Crash-loop protection with restart cooldowns
- Reliable stop/start behavior (no unintended immediate restarts)
- Graceful shutdown preserved when stopping via the app or Windows Services

### Monitoring & Live Operations
- Service status + health indicators (GUI ↔ service heartbeat)
- Online player count (when DB is configured/reachable; safe fallback when not)
- CPU/Memory usage snapshots (periodic refresh)
- Live log viewing of your servers various log files

### Notifications & Security
- **NTFY** notifications with:
  - Basic auth (username/password)
  - Token auth
  - Auth mode selector with dynamic fields
- Sensitive values stored encrypted in `secrets.json` (auto-used on reload)

### Deployment & Portability
- Standard installer via **Inno Setup**
- ProgramData-based config/logs layout for consistent machine-wide storage
- **Portable mode** supported (no installer required)
